# This is a system-wide configuration file used to
# keep track of registries for various container backends.
# It adheres to TOML format and does not support recursive
# lists of registries.

# The default location for this configuration file is /etc/containers/registries.conf.

# The only valid categories are: 'registries.search', 'registries.insecure',
# and 'registries.block'.

[registries.search]
registries = ["registry.redhat.io", "docker.io"]

[registries.insecure]
registries = []


# and add the registries fully-qualified name.

# Docker only
[registries.block]
